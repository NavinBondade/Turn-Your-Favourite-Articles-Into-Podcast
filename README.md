<p>Reading is not everyone's hobby. It is not something everyone likes to do, but to gain knowledge through articles and books, we often sit and read. Reading also requires a quiet and relaxed environment, which is not always possible. This project helps to overcome all these limitations. Here, I have built an AI system that transforms your favorite article into an exciting podcast with a human-like voice. You can listen to this podcast anytime and anywhere, and if you are in a hurry, you can also increase the playback speed to save time.
